# Overview of OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch provides a highly scalable system for providing fast access and response to large volumes of data with an integrated visualization tool, OpenSearch Dashboards, that makes it easy for users to explore their data. From real-time application monitoring, threat detection, and incident management to personalized search experience, OpenSearch Dashboards gives you data visualization tools to tell your data story.      

Out-of-the-box OpenSearch Dashboards includes several tools for discovering and visualizing data, and the OpenSearch suite provides [plugins](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/install/plugins/) to extend and customize dashboard features and functions. 

# Industry examples for real-time search and log analytics at scale 

 OpenSearch is powered by the Apache Lucene search library, and it supports a number of search and analytics capabilities such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) search, SQL, anomaly detection, trace analytics, full-text search, and more.
